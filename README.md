# SECUREAI
This pioneering study employs machine learning to predict startup success, addressing the long-standing challenge of deciphering entrepreneurial outcomes amidst uncertainty. Integrating the multidimensional SECURE framework for holistic opportunity evaluation with AI's pattern recognition prowess, the research puts forth a novel analytics-enabled approach to illuminate success determinants. Rigorously constructed predictive models demonstrate remarkable accuracy in forecasting success likelihood, validated through comprehensive statistical analysis. The findings reveal AI’s immense potential in bringing evidence-based objectivity to the complex process of opportunity assessment. On the theoretical front, the research enriches entrepreneurship literature by bridging the knowledge gap at the intersection of structured evaluation tools and data science. On the practical front, it empowers entrepreneurs with an analytical compass for decision-making and helps investors make prudent funding choices. The study also informs policymakers to optimize conditions for entrepreneurship. Overall, it lays the foundation for a new frontier of AI-enabled, data-driven entrepreneurship research and practice. However, acknowledging AI’s limitations, the synthesis underscores the persistent relevance of human creativity alongside data-backed insights. With high predictive performance and multifaceted implications, the SECURE-AI model represents a significant stride toward an analytics-empowered paradigm in entrepreneurship management.
